     Thanks to <strong> Sue Ambler </strong> for patience and faith during testing times! The first pilot to fly Songbase in a church meeting. Thanks also to the others who have flown the system and helped us get it right, and to the congregation of the Vine Church, Cranbrook.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	 Also to the friends in foreign places who want to use Songbase. (<strong>Austria</strong>, <strong>New Zealand</strong>...) I hope it serves you well, and thanks for 'spreading the blessing'. <br>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align:right; padding-right: 20px; font:italic 95%; font-weight:bold">Wes</div>
